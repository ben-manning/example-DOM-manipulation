## Exercise: Traffic Light

In this exercise, write JavaScript that uses buttons to control the traffic light.

For example, when **Stop** is clicked, light next to it becomes **red**...

**BONUS**: Only one light should be active at a time!

When the page loads, we don’t want any JavaScript to run. We only want it to run when certain elements are **clicked**.

Which element(s)? Let’s start with one of them. How can we uniquely identify it in
our HTML? What ID does it have? What happens when it’s clicked?

Let’s pseudocode this together, and then it will evolve into proper code.
